# Uso documentation

## [The uso user manual](uso_user_manual.md)
is centered around the [examples](../examples) and provides a good introduction to uso.

## [The task manual](manual/00-Introduction_Groovy_ant_Manual.md) 
is heavily based on the [Ant Manual](https://ant.apache.org/manual/) translated to the Groovy AntBuilder DSL. 
Some optional tasks that are included in uso per default such as Groovyc, some Uso specific tasks (such as CreatePom), and the Maven Ant tasks are also included in the manual.
