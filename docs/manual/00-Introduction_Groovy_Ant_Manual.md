# Apache Ant Manual: Groovy AntBuilder DSL Edition

Welcome to the Groovy AntBuilder DSL edition of the Apache Ant Manual. This guide is designed to help users familiar with Apache Ant's traditional XML-based build files to understand and utilize the Groovy AntBuilder, a powerful Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for writing Ant build scripts in Groovy. It provides explanations of the Ant tasks in the context of the Groovy AntBuilder DSL, and practical examples.

This manual aims to cover all standard Ant tasks, as well as the other tasks that are included per default in Uso, showing how their functionality can be achieved using the Groovy AntBuilder and by extension in an Uso build script.

Use the Table of Contents below to navigate to specific tasks or sections. The Appendix provides a general mapping reference and further resources.
