# Ant Task: Input

## Original Ant Task Description

The `input` Ant task is designed to facilitate user interaction during the build process. It achieves this by prompting the user for input and can utilize this input to set properties or control the flow of the build. The task relies on a configured `InputHandler` to manage the interaction.

The prompt displayed to the user can be customized using the `message` attribute or by nesting character data within the `input` element. Furthermore, the task supports defining a set of valid input arguments through the `validargs` attribute. If this is set, the `input` task will only accept values that match one of the predefined arguments, rejecting any other input and prompting the user again.

An important feature is the ability to create a property from the user's input using the `addproperty` attribute. This allows the entered value to be used in subsequent parts of the build process. This behavior is similar to the `property` task, meaning that existing properties cannot be overridden. If the property specified by `addproperty` already exists, the `input` task will not prompt for input if it wouldn't have any effect otherwise (as of Ant 1.6).

A common concern with interactive tasks is security, especially when dealing with sensitive information like passwords. While earlier versions might have had limitations, Java 6 introduced features for secure console input, which Ant versions 1.7.1 and 1.8 have incorporated. This allows for more secure handling of input, especially when using specific handler types.

When running in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the behavior might vary. Some IDEs might hang while waiting for input, while others might provide a mechanism to enter the input. For scenarios requiring sensitive input like passwords, it's often recommended to store them in a secured property file and load them before the `input` task is executed.

## Groovy AntBuilder DSL Equivalent

When using Groovy's `AntBuilder`, you can interact with the `input` task's functionality. While a direct, one-to-one mapping of every feature might involve specific AntBuilder methods or configurations, the core concept of prompting for and receiving user input can be achieved.

For simple prompts and value retrieval, you would typically use methods provided by `AntBuilder` that correspond to the `input` task's parameters. For more complex scenarios, especially those involving secure input or specific input handlers, you might need to ensure the Groovy environment is configured to support these interactions, potentially by setting system properties or using specific Java libraries if `AntBuilder` doesn't directly expose these advanced handler configurations.

### Key Parameters (and their conceptual Groovy equivalents):

*   **`message`**: The prompt displayed to the user. In Groovy, this would be a string argument to the `input` method call.
    *   *Groovy Example*: `ant.input(message: 'Please enter your name:')`
*   **`validargs`**: A comma-separated string of valid inputs. The Groovy equivalent would involve passing these as a list or string and implementing logic to validate the input.
    *   *Groovy Example*: `ant.input(message: 'Proceed? (yes/no)', validargs: ['yes', 'no'])` (This is a conceptual representation; the exact AntBuilder syntax might differ for validation.)
*   **`addproperty`**: The name of the property to store the input. In Groovy, the return value of the input prompt could be assigned to a variable.
    *   *Groovy Example*: `def userInput = ant.input(message: 'Enter value:')`
*   **`defaultvalue`**: The default value if no input is provided.
    *   *Groovy Example*: `def userInput = ant.input(message: 'Enter port [8080]:', defaultvalue: '8080')`

### Handler Configuration (Conceptual for Groovy)

Ant's `input` task allows specifying different input handlers (e.g., default, propertyfile, greedy, secure). If you need to replicate this in a Groovy script using `AntBuilder`:

*   **Default Behavior**: `AntBuilder`'s standard input mechanisms would likely correspond to Ant's default input handling.
*   **Secure Input**: For sensitive data like passwords, you would typically rely on the underlying capabilities of the Java runtime used by Groovy to handle secure input (e.g., by not echoing characters). If `AntBuilder` itself doesn't directly expose a 'secure' mode for its input methods, you might need to use Java's `Console` class directly if running the script in a context where that's available, or ensure the execution environment handles this appropriately.
*   **Property File Input**: If the input needs to come from a property file, you would use Groovy's file reading capabilities to load the properties and then pass them to the relevant Ant tasks or use them in your script logic.

### Example Groovy DSL Usage (Conceptual for User Interaction):

```groovy
// Assuming AntBuilder is initialized as 'ant'

// Example 1: Simple input prompt
// String username = ant.input(message: 'Enter username:') 
// For the purpose of this documentation, we'll assume 'input' is a placeholder
// for how AntBuilder might handle this. In a real scenario, you'd use the specific
// methods provided by the AntBuilder library if it supports direct user input prompts.
// If AntBuilder is primarily for scripting Ant XML, direct console interaction
// might be outside its typical scope, and you'd pre-define properties.

// For setting a property that would be equivalent to Ant's <input addproperty="db.user">:
def dbUser = ant.properties['db.user'] ?: 'defaultUser' // Read existing or use default
// Or, if simulating a prompt:
// dbUser = System.console().readLine("Enter DB User: ") // This is Java, not direct AntBuilder

// Example: Simulating conditional logic based on input
def proceed = ant.input(message: 'Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)', validargs: 'yes,no', addproperty: 'user.confirmation')

// Assuming 'user.confirmation' property is set by the (simulated) input task
if (ant.properties['user.confirmation'] == 'yes') {
    ant.echo(message: 'Proceeding with operations...')
} else {
    ant.echo(message: 'Operation cancelled by user.')
    ant.fail(message: 'Build aborted by user.')
}

// Example: Setting a property with a default value
ant.input(message: 'Enter server address [default: localhost]:', addproperty: 'server.address', defaultvalue: 'localhost')
ant.echo(message: "Server address: ${ant.properties['server.address']}")

```

**Important Note on Groovy DSL Equivalence for `input` task:**

The Ant `input` task is inherently interactive, designed for scenarios where a user provides input *during* the Ant build process. Groovy scripts executed by an Ant task are typically non-interactive in that specific context. 

If the goal is to set properties that would *otherwise* be prompted for by an `input` task when running Ant XML directly, you would achieve this in Groovy by directly setting properties within your script using `ant.properties['propertyName'] = 'value'` or by passing them as parameters when invoking the Groovy script if it's part of a larger build process.

The examples above are conceptual illustrations of how one might try to achieve similar outcomes. The direct equivalent of interactive prompting within an AntBuilder-driven Groovy script might be limited. The primary use of `input` in Ant is for interactive builds, which differs from the typical automated execution model where Groovy scripts are often employed with AntBuilder.

If the intent is to simply pass a pre-determined value to a property (as `addproperty` does), this can be done directly in Groovy when setting up the AntBuilder tasks, without needing a direct equivalent of the `input` task's interactive prompt.

```groovy
// Example: Setting a property directly in Groovy, similar to addproperty
ant.properties['db.user'] = 'myDatabaseUser'
// This property can then be used by other Ant tasks invoked via AntBuilder.

ant.echo(message: "Database user is: ${ant.properties['db.user']}")
```
This direct property setting is often how parameters are managed when scripting Ant tasks with Groovy.
